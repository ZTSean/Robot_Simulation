This is an simple Robot Simulation which are intended to practising and learning robot(AI) programming. There are several versions in **project** directory in which robot are acting different ways interacting with obstacles and targets. In **src** directory, there is a newest version of robot simulation. In newest version, beside animation window there is a control panel which could control some attribute of obstacles, targets, robots and even whole project. If you want to try on other version, change name of **interationX** to **src**.

3. Panel control the range of influence.  
4. Stop, Pause and Resume functionalities implemented.

2. git clone https://github.com/ZTSean/Robot_Simulation.git  
3. open **project** directory in **Terminal** and move to src dir  
4. type **make** and Enter
